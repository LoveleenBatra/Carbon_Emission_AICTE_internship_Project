# Carbon_Emission_AICTE_internship_Project
This project aims to predict the CO2 emission from various parameters such as country, population-specific parameters, economic indicators, land-related, energy use, etc. Our aim is to clean the data, explore it, and make a predictive analysis. Using a robust algorithm, we predict the future values of GHG emissions, mainly CO2.
