# Carbon_Emission_AICTE_internship_Project
This project focuses on predicting CO₂ emissions based on a range of factors, including country-specific demographics, economic indicators, land use, and energy consumption. The goal is to clean and explore the dataset, identify key patterns, and perform predictive analysis. By leveraging a robust machine learning model, we aim to forecast future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a primary emphasis on CO₂.
